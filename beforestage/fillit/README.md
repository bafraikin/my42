#This project is a tetrimino solver written in C

The purpose was to render the smaller square where all tetriminos, given 
by a parsed file, fits together and most likely in the right order.

gene.py is a tiny generator written in python that can generate X 
valid pieces. You just have to redirect them in a file to try out. `make` 
will compile the binary file. 

In src/solver.c there 2 lines commented that you can  uncomment for a better understanding of how the project works.
